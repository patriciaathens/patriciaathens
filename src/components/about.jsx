                <p>
                    I graduated from Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute with a B.S. in Computer Science & Internet Technology Web Sciences with a concentration in AI & Data.
                    As a previous Design Innovation Society major, I have a lot of experience working with different design processes and developing my own unique style as a designer.
                    I've been working in several team projects a year since the beginning of my time at college, making me an efficient leader and a communicative team member.
